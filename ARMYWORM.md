# Ghana Armyworm Anomaly Detection

In Thomas Bilintoh thesis (<a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2220344757?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses"> Link</a>). I've found out interesting things about the region and the pest. 

In 2017 Ghana lost a total of 18,000 hectares of cropland to the African armyworm menace (Ghanaweb,2017). Given such high levels of infestation which threaten food security not only within Ghana but across the globe, several intervention mechanisms have been developed, proposed and implemented by researchers such as Brown (2015) and Faithpraise et al. (2015). Field surveys and remotely sensed data have been paramount to the success of these intervention mechanisms.

While field surveys have been used to populate databases that have variables such as yield, levels of infestation, years of infestation, farm size, pest management practices to mention but a few, the utility of remote sensing has been explored via computation of vegetation indices. The normalized differential vegetation Index (NDVI) stands outs in this regard. Several researchers have used NDVI to measure vegetation loss due to crop pest and subsequently related their findings to a loss in crop yield (Wilson and Gatehouse, 1992; Acharya and Thapa, 2015).

The goal of Thomas Bilintoh study is to validate the relationship between information obtained from
farmers on the subject of African armyworm infestation via remote sensing and statistical
techniques.
