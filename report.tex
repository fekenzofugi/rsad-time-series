\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Research Context and Objectives}
This research internship focuses on the detection of anomalies in agricultural
systems using time-series analysis of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The primary
objectives are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Proof of Concept:} Verify if its possible to detect pest-net installations in plasticulture 
    systems in Mossoró, Brazil, using time-series analysis of Sentinel-2 imagery.
    \item \textbf{Proof of Concept:} Verify if its possible to detect pest infestations, such as Fall Armyworm
    (Spodoptera frugiperda) in maize crops, using time-series analysis of Sentinel-2 imagery.
    \item \textbf{Algorithm Development:} Model anomaly detection algorithms capable of 
    identifying both pest-net installations and pest infestation events in time-series 
    satellite imagery.
    \end{itemize}

In the context of learning anomaly detection techniques applied to remote sensing, the research 
objectives also align with the Brazil–UK–Africa collaboration “SmartPest-Ghana: Exploring 
LLM-driven mobile solutions for climate-smart pest management in maize farming”, 
funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).

In terms of application development, the internship aims to contribute to the
development of a mobile application that leverages the anomaly detection algorithms
to provide real-time pest management recommendations to smallholder farmers in Ghana.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Application Development:} Contribute to the development of a mobile application
     that integrates the Computer Vision and LLM models to provide real-time pest management 
     recommendations to smallholder farmers.
\end{itemize}

\section{Time-Series Analysis Fundamentals}

\subsection{Time-Series Definitions}

\subsubsection{Univariate Time-Series (UTS)}
A univariate time-series represents a single variable (such as NDVI) measured at a single pixel location over time. For a pixel observed at $t$ timestamps, the UTS $X$ is represented as:

\[
X = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_t)
\]

where $x_i$ represents the feature value at timestamp $i \in T$ and $T = \{1, 2, \ldots, t\}$.

\subsubsection{Multivariate Time-Series (MTS)}
A multivariate time-series represents multiple variables that exhibit both temporal dependencies (correlations across time) and spatial dependencies (correlations between variables). For a pixel with $d$ features observed over $t$ timestamps:

\begin{equation}
X = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_t)
  = \bigl(
    (x_1^1, x_1^2, \ldots, x_1^d),
    (x_2^1, x_2^2, \ldots, x_2^d),
    \ldots,
    (x_t^1, x_t^2, \ldots, x_t^d)
    \bigr)
\end{equation}

where $X_i = (x_i^1, x_i^2, \ldots, x_i^d)$ represents the feature vector at time $i$, and $x_i^j$ is the observation at time $i$ for the $j$-th dimension.

\subsection{Time-Series Components}

Understanding the structural components of time-series data is essential for selecting appropriate analysis and smoothing techniques.

\subsubsection{Level}
The level represents the average value of the time-series and can be conceptualized as the mean around which observations fluctuate.

\subsubsection{Stationarity}
A time-series is stationary when its statistical properties (mean, variance, covariance) remain constant over time. Stationarity is an important assumption for many time-series analysis techniques.

\subsubsection{Trend}
The trend captures long-term systematic increases or decreases in the series. Presence of trend typically violates stationarity, as the mean changes over time.

\subsubsection{Seasonality}
Seasonality refers to regular, predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, seasonal cycles in crop development).

\subsubsection{Cyclicity}
Cycles are repetitive patterns similar to seasonality but occurring over longer, less predictable time periods not aligned with calendar intervals. In agricultural contexts, cycles may relate to multi-year climate patterns or economic factors.

\subsection{Time-Series Smoothing Techniques}

Smoothing techniques are essential preprocessing steps that remove noise from time-series data while preserving important patterns. This is particularly critical when comparing pixel time-series or applying distance-based algorithms.

Consider two pixels with similar underlying patterns but different noise characteristics. Without smoothing, distance-based clustering algorithms may incorrectly classify these pixels as dissimilar due to noise rather than genuine differences in behavior. Smoothing addresses this issue by enhancing signal-to-noise ratio.

The choice of smoothing method depends on the structural characteristics of the time-series, as summarized in Table \ref{tab:t1}.

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Smoothing algorithm applicability for different time-series structures}
\label{tab:t1}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Level} & \textbf{Trend} & \textbf{Seasonality} & \textbf{Parameters} \\
\hline

Double HWES  & Yes & Yes & No  & $\alpha, \beta$ \\
Triple HWES  & Yes & Yes & Yes & $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:t2} defines the variables used in smoothing formulations.

$\phi$ & Damped smoothing factor, $\phi \in (0,1)$ \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Moving Average and Weighted Average}
These methods compute the future value as the average (or weighted average) of $k$ previous values. While useful for trend observation and feature engineering, these approaches are unsuitable for satellite time-series with trend and seasonality components.

\subsubsection{Single Exponential Smoothing (SES)}
SES models the level component only and is appropriate for stationary series without trend or seasonality. It weights recent observations more heavily based on the assumption that the future is more closely related to the recent past.

\[
S_0 = X_0
\]

\[
S_t = \alpha X_t + (1 - \alpha) S_{t-1}, \quad t > 0, \; 0 < \alpha < 1
\]

\textbf{Application:} Limited applicability to agricultural time-series, which typically exhibit both trend and seasonality.

\subsubsection{Double Exponential Smoothing (DES)}
DES extends SES by incorporating trend, making it suitable for series with trend but without seasonality.

\[
\begin{aligned}
S_0 &= X_0 \\
B_0 &= X_1 - X_0 \\
S_t &= \alpha X_t + (1 - \alpha)(S_{t-1} + B_{t-1}) \\
B_t &= \beta (S_t - S_{t-1}) + (1 - \beta) B_{t-1}, \quad \alpha, \beta \in (0,1)
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{Application:} Applicable to agricultural time-series when seasonality is not a dominant factor.

\subsubsection{Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES) / Holt-Winters}
TES represents the most comprehensive smoothing approach, modeling level, trend, and seasonality simultaneously. This method is most appropriate for agricultural satellite time-series, which exhibit all three components.

\[
\begin{aligned}
S_0, F_0 &= X_0 \\
B_0 &= \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \left( X_{L+i} - X_i \right)}{L^2} \\
S_t &= \alpha \left( X_t - C_{t \bmod L} \right) + (1 - \alpha)\left( S_{t-1} + \phi B_{t-1} \right) \\
B_t &= \beta \left( S_t - S_{t-1} \right) + (1 - \beta)\phi B_{t-1} \\
C_{t \bmod L} &= \gamma \left( X_t - S_t \right) + (1 - \gamma) C_{t \bmod L} \\
F_{t+m} &= S_t + B_t \sum_{i=1}^{m} \phi^{i} + C_{t \bmod L}, \quad \alpha, \beta, \gamma \in (0,1)
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{Application:} Recommended for Sentinel-2 vegetation index time-series, which exhibit clear seasonal patterns related to crop phenology.

\subsection{Anomalies in Time-Series}
According to Hawkings et al (1980) an anomaly is a data point or sequence that deviates from 
the general data distribution. In a time-series dataset, only a small fraction contains anomalies,
where the majority of the data points follow expected patterns. In remote-sensing data, there is 
a lot of different informations that deviate from normality, such as sensor noise, atmospheric effects,
cloud cover, seasonal variations, and landscape complexity (Fu et al., 2025).
The most meaningful deviations are usually those that are significantly different from the norm.

Anomalies in UTS and MTS can be classified as temporal, intermetric, or 
temporal-intermetric anomalies (Li et al., 2021).  Temporal anomalies can be compared with either 
their neighbours (local) or the whole time series (global), and they present different forms 
depending on their behaviour (Lai et al., 2022).
In our case, we want to detect pest-related anomalies in agricultural fields, which is a temporal  
anomaly 


\subsubsection{Pest-Related Anomalies}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data and Study Regions}
This research utilizes Harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-2A surface reflectance imagery, accessed through Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission consists of two polar-orbiting satellites (2A and 2B) operating in sun-synchronous orbit at 786 km altitude, phased 180° apart.

\subsubsection{Mossoró, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil}
The study area is located in Mossoró, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, where previous field 
assessments and local expertise provide a solid foundation for this research. The region 
is particularly notable for its extensive use of plasticulture in melon cultivation, making 
it a relevant and representative site for analyzing agricultural land-cover dynamics. 
Additionally, pest-management practices, such as the use of pest nets, are commonly e
mployed to protect melon crops. Field observations conducted by the research team 
also confirmed that plastic mulch is often reused across multiple cultivation cycles, 
resulting in areas with visibly deteriorated plastic materials. 
Figure \ref{fig:study_area_mossoro} illustrates the landscape characteristics of this region.

    \label{fig:study_area_ghana}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Kurnool and Gadwal Districts, Southern India}

Prabhakar et al. (2022) conducted field surveys in Kurnool and Gadwal districts of 
Southern India to map FAW infestations in maize crops (sorghum). In his field surveys,
he mapped the regions as healthy, low, medium, and severe infestation levels. Based on that,
we selected one field classified as severe infestation for our proof of concept. The Prabhakar 
et al. (2022) field survey confirmed that the FAW infestation occurred between October 26, 2018 and
November 15, 2018. Figure \ref{fig:study_area_india} shows the agricultural 
landscape characteristics of these districts.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Preprocessing Sentinel-2 Imagery}
Preprocessing is a crucial step in machine learning and data pipelines (Tawakuli et al., 2025). It employs various techniques to ensure that the data fed into a model is clean, consistent, and informative, which directly influences its performance and reliability (Zheng et al., 2021). This is especially important in RSAD modeling. In RS imagery, data quality can be compromised by factors such as Earth's geometric effects resulting from its curvature and rotation, atmospheric conditions like cloud cover, sensor noise, seasonal variations, and landscape complexity (Fu et al., 2025).


\subsection{Spectral Indices}

Spectral vegetation indices (SVI) derived from remote sensing data provide quantitative 
measures of crop health and stress. These indices are particularly effective for detecting 
impacts of diseases and pest invasions. This research employs multiple indices to cap                               ture 
different aspects of plant health:

\subsubsection{Plastic Indices}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Vegetation Indices}

Studies from Dzurune et al. (2025), Bilintoh et al. (2019), Prabhakar et al. (2022), 
have demostrated the effectiveness of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI), respectively, in detecting 
pest infestations. Table \ref{tab:veg_indices} presents the spectral indices used in 
this research, along with their mathematical formulations.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Time-Series Representation and Smoothing}
In this study, we used a Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) representation, where each field 
is represented by multiple spectral indices (NDVI, LAI) over time. This approach captures 
both temporal dynamics and inter-index relationships. Given a field observed over $t$ timestamps,
each vector at time $i$, $X_i$, contains $2$ features (spectral indices):

\begin{equation}
X = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_t)
  = \bigl(
    (x_1^1, x_1^2),
    (x_2^1, x_2^2),
    \ldots,
    (x_t^1, x_t^2)
    \bigr)
\end{equation}

Where $X_i = (x_i^1, x_i^2)$ represents the feature vector at time $i$, 
with $x_i^1$ as NDVI and $x_i^2$ as LAI.

As for smoothing the time-series, we applied Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES) / Holt-Winters,
which effectively models level, trend, and seasonality components present in agricultural
satellite time-series.

\subsection{Proposed anomaly detection model}
We are proposing a AD time-series model that can detect peset infestations in agricultural
fields using Sentinel-2 imagery.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Proof of Concept: Plastic deterioration detection in Mossoró with Sentinel-2} 

\subsection{Proof of Concept: FAW infestation detection in Southern India with Sentinel-2}
To validate wheather S2 time-series can capture FAW infestation,
we followed the methodology proposed by Prabhakar et al. (2022) which analyzed S2
time-series to detect FAW infestation in maize crops in Southern India. Prabhakar et al.
(2022) utilized ground truth data from field surveys to classify infestation severity
levels (healthy, mild, moderate, severe) and correlated these with spectral signatures
and vegetation index time-series derived from S2 imagery. In its field surveys, Prabhakar et al.
(2022) mapped FAW infestation dated from October 26, 2018 to November 15, 2018, these dates and
a severe field were selected for our proof of concept.


\subsubsection{Spectral Signatures of Pest Infestation}

Based on the severity classification framework proposed by Prabhakar et al. (2022), 
FAW damage is categorized into four levels: healthy (Grade-1), low (Grade-2), medium 
(Grade-3), and severe (Grade-4) infestation. In our study, we used the severe cases of the
Prabhakar et al. (2022) field survey data available only at two key moments: 
a pre-infestation survey, representing healthy crop conditions, and a post-infestation survey,
corresponding to severe FAW damage. 
These two surveys were used as temporal anchors to characterize the spectral response 
of maize crops before and after the pest outbreak. Figure 
\ref{fig:india_spectral_response_before_after_infestation} illustrates the contrast 
between pre-attack and post-attack conditions, highlighting notable changes in reflectance 
patterns associated with vegetation stress caused by FAW infestation.

\clearpage
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/india_spectral_response_before_after_infestation.png}
    \caption{Spectral response of maize crops before and after Fall Armyworm infestation in Southern India.}
    \label{fig:india_spectral_response_before_after_infestation}
\end{figure}


However, ground-truth severity assessments were not available for the intermediate 
observation dates within the study period. To address this limitation, we adopted a 
temporal interpolation strategy using the available pre- and post-infestation field 
observations. For dates falling between these two assessment points, infestation 
severity was classified into two intermediate levels: low and medium, 
based on their temporal position in the time series and the magnitude 
of spectral changes observed in the satellite imagery. This approach assumes a 
gradual intensification of FAW damage over time and enables the representation 
of the dynamic evolution of infestation across the growing season, despite the 
absence of continuous ground-based severity monitoring. The resulting spectral 
signatures associated with each severity level are presented in Figure 
\ref{fig:india_spectral_severity_classification}.

\clearpage
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/india_spectral_severity_classification.png}
    \caption{Spectral signatures of maize crops under different severity levels of Fall Armyworm infestation in Southern India.}
    \label{fig:india_spectral_severity_classification}
\end{figure}

Based on the mean spectral response of the field ilustrated in Figure \ref{fig:india_spectral_severity_classification},
we can interpret the its results based on each spectral band characteristics. Near-Infrared (B8): 
carries information about leaf structure. Damage from pest feeding reduces reflectance in this 
band. Blue (B2) and Red (B4) carry chlorophyll information. Chlorophyll absorbs these wavelengths; 
reduction in absorption indicates decreased photosynthetic activity, often caused by pest 
feeding on leaves. Shortwave Infrared (B10-B12) are sensitive to water content. 
Pest-damaged plants often exhibit water stress, detectable in these bands.

Harvest events cause abrupt transitions from high NDVI (green, healthy) to low NDVI 
(senescence, yellow/brown), which must be distinguished from pest-related declines.
Pest-related NDVI declines are more gradual and associated with specific temporal patterns
linked to pest life cycles and feeding behavior.

\subsubsection{Time-Series Vegetation Indexes Analysis}

Figures \ref{fig:india_ndvi_time_series_comparison} and \ref{fig:india_lai_time_series_comparison} 
present the mean NDVI and LAI time-series comparisons between FAW-infested and healthy maize crops in Southern India.
We observe on both plots that the FAW-infested field exibits a significant decline in NDVI and LAI values.
Because NDVI and LAI are indicators of biomass, this decline reflects the damage caused by FAW feeding on the maize plants,
leading to reduced leaf area and overall plant health.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/india_ndvi_time_series_comparison.png}
    \caption{Mean NDVI time series comparison between FAW-infested and healthy maize crops in Southern India.}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/india_lai_time_series_comparison.png}
    \caption{Mean LAI time series comparison between FAW-infested and healthy maize crops in Southern India.}
    \label{fig:india_lai_time_series_comparison}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:india_ndvi_time_series_maps} and \ref{fig:india_lai_time_series_maps} 
show the NDVI and LAI time-series maps of the FAW-infested field in Southern India. 
In both figures, we observe a clear temporal decline in NDVI and LAI values across the field,
corresponding to the period of FAW infestation. The spatial patterns in these maps highlight    
the extent and severity of the damage caused by the pest, with lower index values indicating
areas of more severe infestation and biomass loss.
